# {attributes.title}

I wrote "Start a blog (+ keep it up)" in my Bullet Journal as a goal for 2022. I
don't know why exactly I want a blog, but it's something I've been wanting to do
for a while, so why not bite the bullet? I guess it's a way to get thoughts out,
therapeutic in a sense. It's now February and I've finally set up a blog. I
could have just started writing in a diary, but that doesn't have the same
appeal to it as having a blog online. I guess my inner-web-developer wants to
develop.

The only thing left to do is actually write some stuff to put on it. I guess
this is a start. Hopefully this won't be the last time I actually put something
on here, however likely it is that that will be the case.

I often have ideas for something to write about, but until now I've never had
anywhere to actually write, so the idea gets forgotten as quickly as it came.
Hopefully having this blog set up will be all I need to actually write when
"inspiration" hits. I suppose I could have written on actual pen and paper, but,
as I mentioned, for some reason I can't explain
(<a href="https://youtu.be/dvgZkm1xWPE?t=153" target="_blank">...I know saint
peter won't call my name...</a>), I don't want to do that. Maybe it's my
atrocious hand writing? Maybe it's because writing on a piece of paper that only
I hold means no one will ever see it, and therefore what's the point in writing
it in the first place? Maybe I actually _do_ want that privacy?? oh god, oh
fuck,,,,,, i've made a mistake

I don't know what kind of stuff will end up on here, if anything at all. I think
it's most likely to be brain-dump-type content that I think up on the spot,
about things I find humorous, weird, annoying, cool, interesting... I guess kind
of like a diary? maybe? what do people put in their diaries? wait, diaries are
usually private... maybe this _should_ be private lol

I couldn't even make it through one introductory post before giving up on "good"
grammar and reverting to typing how I type to my friends[^1]. So, fair warning,
there will be absolutely **no** style guide throughout this blog. Anything could
happen...

If you know me, and found this, and made it this far, and see I've not posted
anything since, please do tell me that I should have posted more recently. It
might just nudge me to keep this up! <sup className="text-gray-400"><sup>however
if reading my blog has made u cringe i dont wanna hear it alright</sup></sup>

    This has reminded me of a book I've been reading,
    ["Because Internet" by Gretchen McCulloch](https://gretchenmcculloch.com/book/),
    which is super interesting. Maybe I'll write up my thoughts on that one day.
