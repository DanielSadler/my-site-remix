# Purism

### Overview

[Purism](https://wearepurism.com/) is an online clothes store that is built on
the belief that online shopping shouldn't be a mystery.

I worked with Purism to help build their website. This was a fresh project, and
I was enlisted for frontend development. I was given Adobe XD mockups and
started to convert them into real webpages, using Next JS.

The designs for this site were great, and created some interesting challenges
for me on the frontend, with some weird layouts of overlapping images in places.

<Figure
  src={overlapImg}
  alt="Screenshot of purism home page."
  caption="An example of an overlapping image layout."
/>

As well as simply converting mockups into HTML, there was some more complex work
involved, namely implementing infinite scroll for the shop pages (which also
follow a loose structure).

<Figure
  src={shopImg}
  alt="Screenshot of purism shop page."
  caption="The infinite loading shop page."
/>

The content for the site comes from a custom CMS, built by other developers on
the Purism team who I worked with. There was also some integration with
firebase.

### Tech Details

This site was built with [React](https://reactjs.org), using
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org). Styling was done with
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). These tools all work great together,
allowing me to work quickly and iterate rapidly.

Backend stuff was done via a custom CMS, and Firebase services.

### Conclusion

This was a fun project to work on, with a few interesting challenges we had to
work to solve.
